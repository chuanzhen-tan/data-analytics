# Data Analytics

Welcome to my **Data Analytics** repository!

This repository is where I document my learning and practice in data analytics. It includes projects and exercises focused on working with data, finding patterns, and drawing meaningful insights. The aim is to build a strong foundation in using data to support decisions and solve real-world problems.
