# Cyclistic Case Study

## Overview
This project was originally completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**. The case study analyzed Cyclisticâ€™s bike-share data to uncover insights into customer behavior and inform marketing strategies.

I am now revisiting and improving the project with a more advanced and structured data analytics workflow. The goal is to refine the analysis, strengthen the methodology, and present findings in a clearer, more professional way.
