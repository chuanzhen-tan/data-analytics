# Cyclistic Case Study

## Overview
This project was originally completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**. The case study analyzed Cyclistic’s bike-share data to uncover insights into customer behavior and inform marketing strategies.

I am now revisiting and improving the project with a more advanced and structured data analytics workflow. The goal is to refine the analysis, strengthen the methodology, and present findings in a clearer, more professional way.

## Introduction

Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, manages a network of more than **5,800 bicycles** and **600 docking stations** across the city. The company’s long-term growth strategy prioritizes increasing the number of **annual memberships**, as they provide greater stability and revenue compared to casual riders.

To support this goal, the marketing analytics team seeks to better understand the differences in **usage patterns between casual riders and annual members**. By uncovering these insights, the team can design a data-driven marketing strategy that encourages casual riders to convert into loyal annual members.

The results of this study will be shared with Cyclistic’s executives in the form of **data visualizations and clear, actionable insights**. These findings are expected to guide decision-making and support the company’s growth plans.

### Data Sources
The analysis uses Cyclistic’s historical trip data covering the period from **January 2024 to December 2024**. The data is publicly available and can be accessed from [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). It is provided by Motivate International Inc. under the terms of this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

This dataset offers a comprehensive view of customer behavior across the Cyclistic system. However, data privacy restrictions apply: personally identifiable information (PII) is excluded. As a result, the analysis cannot link individual ride passes to credit card numbers, determine whether casual riders live within the Cyclistic service area, or identify if they have purchased multiple single passes.
